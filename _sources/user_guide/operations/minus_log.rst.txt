Minus Log
=========

.. important::

    This filter requires TomoPy to be available.

This filter applies the :math:`-ln(x)` operation to the intensity of each pixel
in an image.

This uses the TomoPy implementation (:code:`tomopy.prep.normalize.minus_log`)
(docs_).

This is used to convert from a transmission image (i.e. high intensity
indicating transmission through the sample) to attenuation images (i.e. high
intensity indicating attenuation by the sample).

This filter should only be used once image normalisation has been performed.
